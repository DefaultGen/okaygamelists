## Notes:
There is some debate as to whether Pokemon Yellow should be considered a Game Boy or GBC game. The box says Game Boy but the game has certain Super Game Boy and Game Boy Color enhancements. I chose to include it here.
This list includes Game Boy Camera, which most lists do not. Since it includes standalone games on the cartridge and is not merely an accessory, I include it as a game. People are seriously out there with Berlitz French Translator on their GB list but don’t count Game Boy Camera.
The Smurfs was only ever released as Player's Choice in the US. There is a standard release in Europe.
Ghostbusters II and Maru's Mission each have two major box art variants worth noting
At some point Beethoven: the Ultimate Canine Caper, Blues Brothers: Jukebox Adventure, The, FIFA: Road to World Cup 98, Monster Max, and Starhawk were erroneously listed as US releases on Wikipedia
For consistency's sake titles and subtitles are separated by a colon whether it's actually in the title or not. This leads to many situations where the game title is not literally what's printed in the game materials. For example Double Dribble: 5 on 5 is printed as "Double Dribble 5 on 5" on the box and printed as "Double Dribble - 5 on 5" in the manual. As much as I'd love to be strictly accurate, picking any one formatting as correct would make many titles strange and inconsistent. No one wants Wario Land on their list as “Wario Land Super Mario Land 3” with no punctuation which is how the manual refers to it.
The titles starting with "Disney's" or “MTV’s” are often inconsistently referenced between different lists. Similar to Mike Tyson’s Punch-Out!!, this list includes the possessives so long as they don’t only appear on the front of the box. For example The Billiard Congress of America Presents Championship Pool is just titled Championship Pool because that only ever appears as a blurb on front of the box.

##Some weird/inconsistent game titles include:
Arcade Classic No. 1: Asteroids / Missile Command - The slash comes from the game manual. This game (and the three others) are actually only referred to as “Asteroids / Missile Command” in the manual and title screen, but since the Arcade Classic text is all of the covers and clearly not a tagline, I’m including it in the title.

Battletoads / Double Dragon - This formatting comes from the NES manual. It’s never printed in the Game Boy Manual.

Batman Forever - “The Real Game Begins” text is interpreted as a tagline, not a subtitle

Battleship - “The Classic Naval Combat Game” is interpreted as a tagline because it doesn’t appear everywhere on the box and isn’t used within the manual or game.

Bill & Ted's Excellent Game Boy Adventure - “A Bogus Journey!” is a tagline that only appears on the back of the box.

Bo Jackson Hit and Run! Baseball and Football - This game title is a mess. The front packaging refers to it as “Bo Jackson - Two Games in One” and the back of the box lists each game individually. But the manual and title screen refer to it as this so that’s what I’m going with.

Boggle Plus - “3-Minute Word Games” is interpreted as a tagline

BreakThru - “Alexey Pajitnov, Creator of Tetris, Introduces:” only ever appears on the front of the box so I’m not including it in the title.

Championship Pool - For everybody’s sanity I’m leaving out “The Billiard Congress of America Presents” from the title, which does not appear within the manual or on the title screen. The Sega Genesis version actually does have a version of this on the title screen though, jeez.

Choplifter II - Genuinely one of the hardest calls to make in terms of title. The apparent “Rescue Survive” subtitle doesn’t appear within the manual or in the game. Choplifter III is ALSO called “Choplifter III: Rescue Survive” and that subtitle DOES appear in the game itself. I’m still excluding 

Frank Thomas ‘Big Hurt’ Baseball - This formatting comes from the manual

The Black Bass: Lure Fishing - This is the title actually used in the manual and game (sans colon). ‘The’ doesn’t appear in the logo though.

# Unlicensed US releases

Exodus: Journey to the Promised Land
Joshua & the Battle of Jericho
King James Bible
NIV Bible & the 20 Lost Levels of Joshua
Spiritual Warfare

## Notes:

Game Genie, Game Shark, Mega Memory Card, and various models of Action Replay are not included since they are not standalone games.

Monochrome Sachen games (e.g. Beast Fighter) are probably of interest to unlicensed collectors but are out scope for this list. I’m sure someone will say their import shop sold Beast Fighter in the US back in the day.

## Notes:
- This list is potentially incomplete
- Ultra Games was a shell corporation crated as a subsidiary of Konami
- For the following games the second release by Nintendo/Disney Interactive Studios was only a Player's Choice release: DuckTales 2, The Little Mermaid, Mega Man: Dr. Wily's Revenge, Mega Man II, Mickey's Dangerous Chase, Star Wars, The Bugs Bunny Crazy Castle, The Bugs Bunny Crazy Castle 2
- There are publisher name variants such as "Konami, Inc." changing to "Konami of America, Inc.". Since many people would just say "Konami", they're poorly documented, and this isn't my wheelhouse, I did not attempt to include these.

Notes:
The Singer Izik cartridge was bundled with a sewing machine that included a GBC, yet it's backwards compatible. Neat.
There are backwards compatible GBC games on this list with the same name as separate GB games (Asteroids, Monopoly, Prince of Persia, Space Invaders, Titus the Fox, Wario Land II, etc.)
There is some debate as to whether Pokemon Yellow belongs on this list or the main GB list. I’ve chosen to include it on the main GB list.
I've seen 1942, Donald Duck Goin' Quackers, Driver, Formula One 2000, Gex 3, Motocross Maniacs 2, NFL Blitz 2000, NHL Blades of Steel, Ready 2 Rumble, Rhino Rumble, The Smurf's Nightmare, Top Gear Pocket, Vigilante 8, and Xtreme Sports erroneously listed as backwards compatible.
The Game Boy Color Promotional Demo cartridge is also a black cart but isn't backwards compatible
