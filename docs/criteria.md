## Criteria

Each list contains standalone software for the appropriate console. Standalone software means games and non-games to an extent. Taboo: The Sixth Sense is not a game, however it's packaged like all the other NES releases and should clearly be on the list. Action Replay on the other hand is not a cartridge you can do anything with unless you pair it with a game, so it's an accessory and not included.

Games that are substantially the same game are only counted once (e.g. Stadium Events and World Class Track Meet). However games with additional gameplay content may both be counted. For example, Sunday Funday is a reskinned but substantially the same game as Menace Beach, however it includes additional minigames so it is counted separately.

Publisher variants are not counted as separate games (e.g. Caltron vs. Myriad 6-in-1)

Multi-packs, multicarts, and box sets of all kinds are filtered out to separate lists unless they include unique games. For example, Super Mario Bros. / Duck Hunt is not on the licensed NES list, because it contains 2 games that are already represented there. However, Maxi 15 is on the unlicensed NES list because the game Stakk'M is exclusive to the cartridge even though the other 14 games are already represented.

Listed games should've been somehow obtainable by a consumer, whether that means Blockbuster sold a used "rental exclusive" at the end of its life, Nintendo Power gave it away in a contest, or you submitted mayonnaise UPCs for a chance to win. This is meant to exclude prototypes, samples, and most competition carts, however not smaller promotional releases. Motoko-chan no Wonder Kitchen is a Super Famicom Game you could only win in a lottery after submitting mayo UPCs, however 10,000 copies were given away. Despite the unorthodox distribution, it is certainly a full game intended for the public.

**Ultimately, subjective calls have to be made** no matter how specific you make your criteria. Do the Dreamcast Web Browsers count? Does the original free Xbox Live Arcade Launcher CD? Wii Netflix? The pack-in "What is X'eye" informational CD? Anything worth thinking about will be noted whether it's included or not.

## Choosing one title per game

Every entry on each of these lists is indivdually verified and I've subjectively chosen the single best title in my opinion based on the box, manual, and title screen. Many games have multiple variously formatted or ambiguous titles. It is out of the scope these lists to fully rectify this. If you are maintaining a database of video games, it is very useful to include all variations of a game title. These lists are not meant to replace such a database.

Subjective choices _have_ to be made here. You can't say "What it says on the box is the title of the game, period" or else you'd be calling Pepsiman "Drink!"

### Punctuation

For consistency's sake titles and subtitles are separated by a colon whether it's actually in the title or not. This leads to many situations where the game title is not literally what's printed in the game materials. For example Double Dribble: 5 on 5 is printed as "Double Dribble 5 on 5" on the box and printed as "Double Dribble - 5 on 5" in the manual. As much as I'd love to be strictly accurate, picking any one formatting as correct would make many titles strange and inconsistent. No one wants Wario Land on their list as “Wario Land Super Mario Land 3” with no punctuation, which is how the manual refers to it.

### Possessives

The titles starting with "Disney's" or “MTV’s” are often inconsistently referenced between different lists. Similar to Mike Tyson’s Punch-Out!!, these lists include the possessives if the majority of the front of the box, interior of the game manual, and title screen agree on it. For example Game Boy's "The Billiard Congress of America Presents Championship Pool" is just titled "Championship Pool" because the possessive only ever appears as a blurb on front of the box.

For games with significant inconsistencies or disagreements, I'm just going to make a judgement call (and that judgement call will likely be dropping the inconsistent parts altogether). For example The Immortal is written as Will Harvey Presents The Immortal, Electronic Arts Presents The Immortal, The Immortal, and even Immortal. Like a sane person, I'm just going with "The Immortal" here.

### Retitled Games

Many games have been retitled in their lifespan. For example, Stadium Events was re-released as World Class Track Meet after a publisher change. ESPN Extreme Games was renamed 1Xtreme for the Greatest Hits release after losing the ESPN license. These lists include the first title as the canonical title. The lists do **not** include both titles as separate entries if they are substantially the same game. A different title screen is not a different game. Retitled games will be noted below the lists so you can make your own distinction.
