# Okay Game Lists
Okay Game Lists is a personal project to create simple, copy/pastable, correct lists of video games for collectors. Is Nintendo World Championships in your NES list? Why? Why not? Is Game Genie? Is Huge Insect? Every list maker has criteria and assumptions about what "counts" for a list of video games, but rarely explains what was included and exluded and why.

The intention for these lists is to make it easy to understand what is included, what wasn't included, what's on the edge, and why. Each console is broken into multiple significant lists (e.g. licensed, unlicensed, players choice) and has notes explaining why certain games may be included or excluded. For example, Game Boy Camera is included on the Game Boy list because it is a cartridge with games on it. If you want to exclude it as an accessory, you can just read the notes then delete it from the list if you disagree. Similarly, Game Genie isn't on the list because its not a game, but the notes at least mention its existence if you want to include it.

Every entry on each of these lists is indivdually verified and I've chosen the "most correct" title in my opinion based on the box, manual, and title screen. Many games have multiple variously formatted or ambiguous titles. It is out of the scope these lists to try to rectify this, but I did try to pick the best one so you don't end up with nonsense like "Aladdin (Disney's)" in your list of games is if the Disney's is in parentheses at the end of the title.

Each game on these lists is individually vetted, considered, and re-titled. Nothing is copy pasted.
