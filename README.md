# Okay Game Lists
Okay Game Lists is a project to create simple, annotated, copy-pastable lists of video games for collectors. Is Nintendo World Championships in your NES list? Why? Why not? Is Game Genie? Is Huge Insect? Every list maker has criteria and assumptions about what "counts" for a list of video games, but rarely explains what was included and excluded and why.

The intention for these lists is to make it easy to understand what is included, what's on the edge, and why so you can build your own list(s). Each console is broken into multiple significant lists (e.g. licensed, unlicensed, players choice) and has notes explaining why certain games may be included or excluded. For example, Game Boy Camera is included on the Game Boy list because it is a cartridge with games on it. Game Genie is not on the list because it's not a game. Since either of these _could_ be  contentious, the notes explain the reasoning so you can make your own decision on whether to cut them or not.

Every entry on each of these lists is indivdually verified and I've chosen the "most correct" title in my opinion based on the box, manual, and title screen. Many games have multiple variously formatted or ambiguous titles. It is out of the scope these lists to try to rectify this, but I did try to pick the best one so you don't end up with nonsense like "Aladdin (Disney's)" in your list of games as if the Disney's is in parentheses at the end of the title.

Each game on these lists is individually vetted, considered, and re-titled. Nothing is copy pasted.
